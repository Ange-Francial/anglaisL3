Step one, identify the target and its flaws. They're always flaws. I learned that early in life. 
My first hack, the local library, a vulnerable FTP server, and it's as 400. A far cry from the Android zero days I'm using to own the FBI standard issue smartphone. The library was a test to see if I could even get into the system. 
I've since set greater goals. For instance, step two, build malware and prepare an attack. At my fingertips, the zero day is wrapped in code like a Christmas present, then becomes an exploit, the programmatic expression of my will. 
I live for this ship. Step three, a reverse shell, two stage exploit. The ideal package load the malware into a femtocell delivery system, my personal cell tower that'll intercept all mobile data. 
Similar to my first time, when I found myself staring at latebook fees, employee names, member addresses. Everything was revealed. The secret of the perfect tack? Make it infallible. 
Hidden within the kernel as a logic bomb. Malicious code designed to execute under circumstances I've programmed. Should the FBI take an image of the femtocell, all memory will self corrupt or explode. 
Step four, write the script. Why do it myself? Because that's how I learned, and I know exactly when and how it's going to run. I didn't do anything harmful my first time. 
Just looked around. But I felt so powerful. Eleven years old and in complete control of the Washington Township Public Library. 
Today is different. I hacked the world. Final step, launch the attack. 
Once I do all on the Android phone of every FBI agent in that building, I'll own evil corpse, network, applications, everything. Domain admin. This, the thrill of poning a system. 
This is the greatest rush. God access. The feeling never gets old. 
We need to talk to the old assisted man. The old It guy set this up. There's an encrypted database on the old server I'm going to need access to. 
You want to talk to RT? If that's his name. I'll talk to Ray, see what's what.
